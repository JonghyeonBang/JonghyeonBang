I'm interested in developing radar signal processing algorithms that help extract meaningful data â€” and I'm also into combining signal processing with deep learning! Currently, I'm pursuing my Ph.D. at Virginia Tech, where I'm working with Professor [Mike Willis](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=EsBarIgAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) on exploring the glaciers of Greenland using passive radar.

I earned both my B.S. and M.S. degrees in Electronics Engineering from Pusan National University. During that time, I worked on signal processing for passive radar and LPI radar. After graduation, I joined the Agency for Defense Development, where I researched SAR jamming as a full-time researcher. Now, I'm chasing a new dream as a Ph.D. student in Geosciences at Virginia Tech!
